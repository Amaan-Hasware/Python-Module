#           Linear Algebra
#
#
# 4) Pandas (MOST WIDELY USED):
#           PANDAS Stand for python data analysis
#           Used for data analysis and cleaning
# Features:
#           Eloquent syntax and Rich functionalities
#           'Apply()' enables you to run a function across a series of data
#           High Level Abstraction
#           Contains high-level data structures and manipulation tools
# Application:
#           General Data wrangling
#           Useful in ETL jobs in data storage and transformation
#           Used in varieties of Academic and commercial domains including statistics etc
#           Useful in time series specific functionality
#
#
# 5) MatPlotLib:
#           Plotting library for python
#           Used for data visualization
#           It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications
# Features:
#           As usable as matlab with an advantage of free and open source
#           Supports dozens of backend and output types
#           Pandas can itself be used a wrappers around MATPLOTLIB's API
#           Small memory consumption and very good runtime behaviour
# Applications:
#           Correlation of analysis of variables
#           Visualize 95% confidence intervals of the models
#           Outlier Detection
#           Visualizing the distributions to gain instant insights
